# Welcome!

**Welcome to the Fascinating World of Numerical Algorithms!**

In this module, we invite you to explore numerical algorithms' intricate and compelling world, where precision meets practicality. 

As your gateway into this subject, we'll delve into the essentials of numerical linear algebra and numerical analysis. Our journey will cover crucial techniques such as LU, QR and Singular Value Decomposition as well as eigenvalue computations in numerical linear algebra. In the domain of numerical analysis, we'll explore orthogonal approximation, interpolation, and quadrature.

These foundational concepts are not only intellectually enriching but also serve as the cornerstone for advanced numerical methodologies. The methodologies are instrumental in diverse fields, including data science and the solution of complex Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Prepare to engage with these topics deeply, enhancing also your understanding and application in various scientific and technological contexts.

We hope you enjoy this module and find it as fascinating as we do!
